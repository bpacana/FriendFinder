# FriendFinder

### Overview

This app is themed after the Game of Thrones and it will take in the user's answers to 10 questions, compare them to the current "friends", and will return the best match (the "friend" with the least cumulative difference between the individual answers).

### Instructions

1. These are the links to Heroku and Github:

   * Heroku: [Friend Finder App](https://damp-ravine-92978.herokuapp.com/)

   * GitHub: [Friend Finder GitHub Repository](https://github.com/bpacana/FriendFinder)

2. On the Home page there is a link to the quiz, a link to the GitHub repository, and a link to the Members API that will display current friends in JSON format.

3. All fields in the quiz must be answered.

4. Click `Submit` after answering all the questions in the quiz. The app will then return the best match of the friends in the database.

5. Select `Done` to close the modal. Select `Redo?` to clear the answers (leaving the name and photo information) and start the quiz over.
